## Introduction

The Kaggle Mining Optimiser project uses machine learning models to predict and optimize the concentration of iron and silica in mining operations. The models are trained using historical data and various features related to the mining process.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the project, use the following command:

## Configuration

You can configure the project by editing the following files in the `config` folder: `general.yaml`, `data.yaml`, `model.yaml`, `clustering.yaml`, `simulation.yaml`, and `optimisation.yaml`.

## Results

Here are some example results from the model:
